It happens to be the 6 Month Anniversary of owning a Uni a-gel Switch today! <!--more-->

This pencil is spectacular for the price point. At $12, it's actually kind of a bargain for the usability, comfort and strong construction of this pencil. This pencil has been my daily writer (having used the DelGuard for doing Math) for around six months at this point, coincidentally the same as my DelGuard.

To begin, the main selling point of this thing: It can switch between a Kuru Toga Engine and a normal, holding mechanical pencil at the twist of a knob near the pencil's clutch. By default in Kuru Toga mode, the pencil writes spectacularly, using the Toga W Speed Engine (one rot/20 strokes) for making writing feel amazing. It's a Kuru Toga without all the problems of a Kuru Toga... and that's what I love about it.

For those who don't know, the Kuru Toga is Uni's other flagship pencil which boasts the auto-rotating mechanism described above. It'll rotate your lead every ~40 strokes (20 strokes with the W Speed engine) in order to ensure you have a perfectly sharp pencil tip at all times. The issue with many mechanical pencils is that they get a very blunt tip after some usage, but you can't sharpen them like you can with a regular wooden pencil. The Kuru Toga mechanism is the solution to that issue.

The other reason I adore this pencil, aside from the extremely useful Kuru Toga/HOLD switch, is the grip. This is a Kuru Toga with a Uni Î±-gel grip, and it's so, so comfortable. This grip is squishy, comfortable, and does not attract dust like the aforementioned DelGuard Type-GR does. Over 6 months of constant use, it's showed no signs of visible wear or use. Aside from some of my dumb bite marks on the clutch/eraser cap, it's in perfect condition. The brand markings and "HD II | 0.5" text printed onto it have also not shown any sign of fading. Additionally, the thing just looks cool!
My favorite part of all Kuru Toga-powered pencils is the visible, "demonstrator"-style transparency which shows the rotation of the engine in real time. This isn't a transparent pencil, however; Uni instead has opted to add a small window to the pencil which shows a changing color to signify the rotation of the Kuru Toga engine (so you can confirm that it's working and not jammed)

Speaking of jamming, this pencil has had no jamming issues at all. I've never once had a lead jam which required me to take out a safety pin and go on a five-minute long adventure to remove. This is a serious issue with some pencils with more "advanced" technology, like the Pentel Orenz Nero or Orenz AT (both of which experience seriously annoying jam issues so frequently that Pentel had to place a small unjamming pin in the head of the eraser cap)

My one gripe is that it's constructed out of pretty cheap feeling plastic. A metal-constructed version of this pencil would be an instant purchase for me, and probably end up in my every-day carry.

Overall, this thing is awesome. This pencil can do math with a blunt tip, and quickly revert back to an excellent writer with the twist of a knob. It's for the everyday person who doesn't have seven-hundred different pencils for each use case; Since I'm obsessive over my pens and pencils, I tend to have around 5 or 6 pencils with me every day for different uses; but that's definitely not for everyone. Pick one up if you need a new comfortable and utility-focused pencil.
