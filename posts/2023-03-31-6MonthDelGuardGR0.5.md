So, I've been essentially torturing a Zebra DelGuard Type-GR 0.5mm for a few months now. Constant use, almost every single<!--more--> day. I'll say this about it...it's just not an interesting pencil for the price point.

Let's start with what I like.... which is the main selling point of the DelGuard: An automatic system which prevents lead breakage through a combination of a guide pipe & internal "load balancer" spring system. It's amazing, and works really well out of the box. The lead is so hard to break, meaning Zebra has definitely made sound engineering decisions here- and after 6 months of constant usage, this feature's efficacy hasn't depreciated at all. It's just as strong as it was day-one.

However, the DelGuard is, in my opinion, not a great pencil outside of this anti-breakage system. The grip is horrible and very stiff; The grip on a Uni-Ball Alpha Gel Switch, for example, is far more squishy, comfortable and doesn't attract dust like crazy. The Type-GR has barely ever left my pencil case outside of when I'm using it, and yet, the grip has become "crusty" and dusty as all hell. Cleaning it is a nightmare too, as the traditional water+microfiber doesn’t work all too well. You need to really disassemble the pencil and clean the grip section thoroughly in order for it to last.

Additionally, the pencil’s clip is terribly fragile. It broke off within a month of me using it casually- which is a real pain. I haven’t tried the Type-LX or Type-ER, the two other DelGuard models, but I imagine they have a better grip and a slightly more durable clip. I just wish this pencil had something to write home about which wasn’t the load balancer.
Plus, they really need to make smaller lead sizes available for this pencil. It sucks that I’m limited to 0.5mm for the Type-GR and can only find 0.3mm on the Type-LX.

All in all though, the DelGuard is a fairly reliable, decent pencil choice. It’s not insanely expensive (i.e. Rotring 600, 800 or Orenz Nero/AT) but not too cheap either. The pencil boasts a strong anti-breakage system, which is truly a godsend if you really push your pencils into your paper like I do. This pencil solves the main gripe I have with many others: the guide pipe just isn’t strong enough and the anti-breakage of other pencils (especially 0.2mm and 0.3mm) is just not satisfactory or even close to the level of the DelGuard. But, for long-term use, I wouldn’t recommend it. Be prepared to spend a little bit on a new one of these every few months.
