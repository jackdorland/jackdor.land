## ジャック・どろぁんど 
### jack dorland (he/they)

A personal website and blog to house all of my pens, pencils, politics, dreams, desires, hopes, troubles, and much more. This website/blog is created with [***Hakyll***](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/), which I **highly** recommend for anyone looking to start their own blog in the future.

The file structure of this website is pretty much exactly what you see on the tin — images are in [assets/images](assets/images), stylesheets are in [assets/stylesheets](assets/stylesheets), templates and partials are in [templates/](templates/), etc...

Posts will be periodically added to [posts/](posts/) and automatically reflected onto [**pens, pencils and politics**](https://jackdor.land/blog) after compilation. 

My only contact method is [**jack@jackdor.land**](mailto:jack@jackdor.land). I do not use social media of any kind. Feel free to contact me in English or 日本語. Please refrain from sending me any emails vying for personal information or for marketing purposes. If you have a question about one of my interests, or this blog, I'll always be happy to answer!
